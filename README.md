# Image_Classification-Paav_Bhaaji
The aim is to predict the genuiness of image of Pavbhaji.  I will be using the Fastai library. It is a deep learning library which provides practitioners with high-level components that can quickly and easily provide state-of-the-art results in standard deep learning domains, and provides researchers with low-level components that can be mixed and matched to build new approaches. It aims to do both things without substantial compromises in ease of use, flexibility, or performance.
